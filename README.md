# Water-Level-Sensor
Description and Technical Data The water level sensor / leak detection sensor is a 3-pin module that outputs an analog signal (generally 0 to 500) that indicates the approximate depth of water submersion. When used in conjunction with a pull up resistor, it can be used as a digital device to indicate the presence or water.
